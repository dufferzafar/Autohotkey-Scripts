<FONT face=verdana>
<FONT size=3><B><P>Introduction</P></B><FONT size=2>
<P align=justify>I manage a system where I need to restrict users from accessing the desktop and running other applications.
The search for ways to acheive this returned several different techniques.
Although in the end I didn't use any of the techniques described here, I decided to compile all the code in 
one application for everyone how should need it.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Note:</B> I don't claim to be the author of any of the code presented in this article. The application is a compilation
of several sources and I will try to acknowledge the authors whenever possible.</P>

<FONT size=3><B><P>I. Hidding Desktop Windows</P></B><FONT size=2>
<P align=justify>Hidding the Windows Desktop, Taskbar, Start Button,..., is generally acheived by passing the window handle 
returned by <I>FindWindow()</I> to <I>ShowWindow()</I>.</P>
<P align=justify>If, for example, you want to hide the Taskbar you can use the following code:</P>

<PRE><FONT size=2>	ShowWindow(FindWindow("Shell_TrayWnd", NULL), SW_HIDE);</PRE>

<P align=justify>If you want to hide the Start Button, you have to know the button control id first and use the same technique:</P>

<PRE><FONT size=2>	ShowWindow(GelDlgItem(FindWindow("Shell_TrayWnd", NULL), 0x130), SW_HIDE);</PRE>

<P align=justify>How do I know that the Taskbar class name is "Shell_TrayWnd" or that the Start Button id is 0x130 ? I used
the Spy++ utility that comes with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. You can use this technique for any window or
control you wish to hide.</P>
<P align=justify>If you want just to disable the window, and not hidding it, change the <I>ShowWindow()</I> call to <I>EnableWindow()</I>.</P>

<P align=justify>You will see that if you hide the Desktop and the Taskbar, the Start Menu still pop up when you press the Win
key or double click the desktop area. To find out how to prevent this unwanted behaviour you have to read 
the next section.</P>

<FONT size=3><B><P>II. Disabling System Keys</P></B><FONT size=2>
<P align=justify>I call system keys all the special key combinations that the operating system (OS) use to switch between tasks 
or bring up the Task Manager.</P>
<P align=justify>There are several ways to disable these key combinations.</P>

<P><B>Win9x/Me</B></P>
<P align=justify>You can disable all these key combinations (including Ctrl+Alt+Del) by fooling the operating system into
thinking the screen saver is running. This can be acomplished with the following code:</P>

<PRE><FONT size=2>	SystemParametersInfo(SPI_SETSCREENSAVERRUNNING, TRUE, &bOldState, 0);</PRE>

<P align=justify>This trick doesn't work in Windows NT or higher (Win NT+) so you need other techniques.</P>

<P><B>Hooks</B></P>
<P align=justify>In Win NT+ one way to trap key switching combinations is to write a keyboard hook. You install a keyboard
hook by calling <I>SetWindowsHookEx()</I>:</P>

<PRE><FONT size=2>	hKeyboardHook = SetWindowsHookEx(WH_KEYBOARD, KeyboardProc, hInstance, 0);</PRE>

<P align=justify>The KeyboardProc() function is a CALLBACK function that is called by the OS every time a key is pressed.
Inside KeyboardProc() you decide if you want to trap the key or let the OS (or the next application in the 
hook chain) process it:</P>
<PRE><FONT size=2>	LRESULT KeyboardProc(...)
	{
	   if (Key == VK_SOMEKEY)
		return 1;             // Trap key

	  return CallNextHookEx(...); // Let the OS handle it
	}
</PRE>
<P align=justify>To release the hook you use:</P>

<PRE><FONT size=2>	UnhookWindowsHookEx(hKeyboardHook);</PRE>

<P align=justify>There are two type of hooks: local and global (or system wide) hooks. Local hooks can only trap events for your
application, while global hooks can trap events for all the running applications.</P>
<P align=justify>To trap the switching task keys it's necessary to write a global hook.</P>
<P align=justify>The Microsoft documentation states that global hook procedures should be placed in a separate DLL. The DLL is
then mapped into the context of every process and can trap the events for each process -- that's why hooks are
used to inject code into a remote process.</P>
<P align=justify>In my application I wanted to avoid the use of an external library so I
setted the global hook inside my own application (without an external library). This is acomplished by passing
in the 3rd parameter of the <I>SetWindowsHookEx()</I> call the instance handle of the application (and not the library
as the documentation states). This technique works perfectly for Win 9x but Win NT+ is different. The same
effect can be acheived by using the new keyboard and mouse low level hooks. These new hooks don't need and
external library because they work differently from the other hooks. The documentation states "[...] the 
WH_KEYBOARD_LL  hook is not injected into another process. Instead, the context switches back to the process 
that installed the hook and it is called in its original context. Then the context switches back to the application 
that generated the event.".</P>
<P align=justify>I'm not going into more details about hooks because there are many excelent articles dealing with this subject.</P>

<P align=justify>There's still one remaining problem: keyboard hooks cannot trap Ctrl+Alt+Del sequence ! Why ? Because the OS
never sends this key combination to the keyboard hook chain. It is handled at a different level in the OS
and is never sended to applications. So, how can we trap the Ctrl+Alt+Del key combination ? Read the next section
to find out.</P>

<P><B>Ctrl+Alt+Del</B></P>
<P align=justify>There are several ways to disable this key combination:</P>
<UL>
<P>1. Disable Task Manager.<BR>This doesn't trap the key combination, it simply disables the application (Task Manager)
that pop up when this key combination is pressed. See below how to do this.</P>
<P>2. Trap the keys using a keyboard device driver.<BR>For this you need the DDK installed. I will not describe this method here.</P>
<P>3. Write a GINA stub.<BR>GINA is the DLL that Winlogon uses to perform user authentication. I'm not going to discuss
this method here, but you can find out how to it here <A href="#16">[16]</A>.</P>
<P>4. Subclass the SAS window of the Winlogon process.<BR>For this you must inject code into the Winlogon process 
and then subclass it's Window Procedure. Two techniques for doing this are described latter.</P>
</UL>
<P><B>Disable Task Manager</B></P>
<P align=justify>To disable the Task Manager you only have to enable the policy "Remove Task Manager" either using the
Group Policy editor (gpedit.msc) or setting the registry entry. Inside my application I used the registry
functions to set the value for the following key:</P>

<PRE><FONT size=2>	HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\DisableTaskMgr:DWORD</PRE>

<P align=justify>Set it to 1 to disable Task Manager and 0 (or delete key) to enable it again.</P>

<P><B>Subclassing Winlogon's SAS window</B></P>
<P align=justify>You subclass a windows procedure by calling</P>

<PRE><FONT size=2>	SetWindowLong(hWnd, GWL_WNDPROC, NewWindowProc);</PRE>

<P align=justify>The call only works for windows create by your application, i.e., you cannot subclass windows belonging
to other processes (the address of <I>NewWindowProc()</I> is only valid for the process that called the <I>SetWindowLong()</I>
function).</P>
<P align=justify>So, how can we subclass Winlogon SAS window ?</P>
<P align=justify>The answer is: you have to somehow map the address of <I>NewWindowProc()</I> into the address space of 
the remote process and pass it to the <I>SetWindowLong()</I> call.</p>
<P align=justify>The technique of mapping memory into the address space of a remote process is called Injection.</P>
<P align=justify>Injection can be acompished with the following ways:</P>
<UL>
<P>1. Registry. 
   To inject a DLL into a process simply add the DLL name to the registry key
<PRE><FONT size=2>	HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs:STRING</PRE>
   This method is only supported on Windows NT or higher.
<P>2. Injecting a DLL using hooks.
   This method is supported by all Windows versions.
<P>3. Injecting a DLL using <I>CreateRemoteThread()</I>/<I>LoadLibrary()</I>.
   Only usable in Windows NT or higher.
<P>4. Copy the code directly to the remote process using <I>WriteProcessMemory()</I> and start its execution by calling 
   <I>CreateRemoteThread()</I>.
   Only usable in Windows NT or higher.
</UL>
<P align=justify>My prefered injection technique is the last one. It has the advantage of not needing an external DLL.
To properly work this method requires very careful coding of the functions you are injecting onto the remote process.
To help you to avoid common pitfalls of this technique I inserted some tips at the beginning of the source code.
For people who think this method is too dangerous I included also the <I>CreateRemoteThread()</I>/<I>LoadLibrary()</I> method.
Just #define DLL_INJECT and the application will use this method instead.</P>

<P align=justify>After injecting the code into Winlogon's subclassing the SAS window reduces too:</P>
<UL>
1. Getting the SAS window handle: <PRE><FONT size=2>      hSASWnd = FindWindow("SAS Window class", "SAS window");</PRE>
2. Subclass the SAS window procedure: <PRE><FONT size=2>      SetWindowLong(hSASWnd, GWL_WNDPROC, NewSASWindowProc);</PRE>
3. Inside <I>NewSASWindowProc()</I> trap the WM_HOTKEY message and return 1 for the Ctrl+Alt+Del key combination:
<PRE><FONT size=2>      LRESULT CALLBACK NewSASWindowProc(HWND hWnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
      {
  	   if (uMsg == WM_HOTKEY)
  	   {
            // Ctrl+Alt+Del
            if (lparam == MAKELONG(MOD_CONTROL | MOD_ALT, VK_DELETE))
               return 1;
  	   }
  	   return CallWindowProc(OldSASWindowProc, hWnd, wParam, lParam);
	}
</PRE>
</UL>
<FONT size=3><B><P>Other Techniques</P></B><FONT size=2>
<P><B>1. RegisterHotKey()/Me</B></P>
I only managed to disable Alt+Tab and Alt+Esc key combinations using this method.

<P><B>2. SystemParametersInfo(SPI_SETSWITCHTASKDISABLE/SPI_SETFASTTASKSWITCH)</B></P>
In all the versions I tried this method never worked !

<P><B>3. Switch to a new desktop</B></P>
With this technique you create a new desktop and switch to it. Because the other processes
(normally) run on the "Default" desktop (Winlogon runs on the "Winlogon" desktop and the 
screen saver runs on the "Screen-saver" desktop) this has the effect on effectively locking 
the windows desktop until the process that runs in the new desktop has finished.

The following code describes the steps necessary to create and switch to a new desktop
and run a thread/process in it:
<PRE><FONT size=2>	// Save original desktop
	hOriginalThread = GetThreadDesktop(GetCurrentThreadId());
	hOriginalInput = OpenInputDesktop(0, FALSE, DESKTOP_SWITCHDESKTOP);

	// Create a new Desktop and switch to it
	hNewDesktop = CreateDesktop("NewDesktopName", NULL, NULL, 0, GENERIC_ALL, NULL);
	SetThreadDesktop(hNewDesktop);
	SwitchDesktop(hNewDesktop);

	// Execute thread/process in the new desktop
	StartThread();
	StartProcess();

	// Restore original desktop
	SwitchDesktop(hOriginalInput);
	SetThreadDesktop(hOriginalThread);

	// Close the Desktop
	CloseDesktop(hNewDesktop);
</PRE>
To assign a desktop to a thread <I>SetThreadDesktop(hNewDesktop)</I> must be called from within the
running thread. To run a process in the new desktop the <I>lpDesktop</I> member of the <I>STARTUPINFO</I>
structure passed to <I>CreateProcess()</I> must be setted to the name of the desktop.

<FONT size=3><B><P>Final Notes</P></B><FONT size=2>
<P align=justify>In the introduction I refered that at the end I didn't use none of the techniques described in this article.</P>
<P align=justify>The strongest method of securing the windows desktop is to change the system shell by your own shell (that is, 
by your own application).</P>
<P align=justify>In Windows 9x edit the file <I>c:\windows\system.ini</I> and in the <I>[boot]</I> section
change the key <I>shell=Explorer.exe</I> by <I>shell=MyShell.exe</I>.</P>
<P align=justify>In Windows NT or higher you can replace the shell by editing the following Registry key</P>

<PRE><FONT size=2>	HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell:STRING=Explorer.Exe</PRE>

<P align=justify>This is a global change and affect all users. To affect only certain users
edit the following Registry key:</P>

<PRE><FONT size=2>	HKLM\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit:STRING=UserInit.Exe</PRE>

<P align=justify>Change the value of <I>Userinit.exe</I> by <I>MyUserInit.exe</I></P>

<P align=justify>Here's the code for <I>MyUserInit</I>:</P>
